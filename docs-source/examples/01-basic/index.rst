Basic
============================

These examples step through a few basic concepts of the ``upytester``, and
puts them into functioning examples.

I will also introduce the general concept of abstracting the complexities of
a test-bench, and various test components for a project into separate
files and modules.
Although this isn't strictly necessary to use ``upytester``,
I've made this part of the lesson-plan because I feel it's important to
keep your test suite coherant, and maintainable, and your tests simple and
unambiguous.
